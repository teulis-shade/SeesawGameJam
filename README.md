## Premise
The goal is simple. Reach the moon without crashing into the Earth. As you collect more weight you’ll progressively launch higher and higher. Make sure you hit your side of the seesaw or else you’ll crash! 

## Controls
Move right and left with the arrow keys to control your descent. If you manage to grab a rocket you can launch yourself a little higher with the space bar.
